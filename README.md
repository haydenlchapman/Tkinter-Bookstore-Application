# Tkinter-Bookstore-Application
A Tkinter-powered mock bookstore app! A recreation of my first-ever Python project, this time replete with modularity, readability, and common sense.

## Background and Motivation
Anyone that's taken Computer Graphics at WVU in the past few years will likely recognize this project. In the *exceedingly rare* chance that you don't fall into that category, our class was tasked with using Tkinter to construct a mock-bookstore application just the like the one you see here. Unfortunately for me, however, this assignment served as not only my introduction to GUI programming, but as my first significant Python deliverable. Needless to say, it had a lot of problems. My parameter lists were exceptionally long for no good reason, I haphazardly attempted an object-oriented approach but didn't make use of it at all, my coding style was unconventional, and, worst of all, my application really didn't look that good. Rough stuff.

Luckily I slid by with a decent grade on the assignment, but it stuck around in the back of my mind for a while, and eventually found itself on the list of projects I was interested in grinding out properly. At first, I attempted refactoring the existing code, but it wasn't long before I decided that starting from scatch would not only be much easier, but also enable me to learn a lot more.

Ultimately, these are my goals for the project:
- Improved coding style (PEP8).
- Better OOP (particularly with regard to separation of concerns).
- A prettier application.
- Expanded functionality (new features, custom book lists).
- Deployment as an executable
- Cementation of my Python fundamentals.
- Expertise with Tkinter.
- A well-crafted implementation of Tkinter that can serve as a reference for other prospective GUI gods.
- A fully realized project written with a technology that, despite not being very trendy, is powerful, easy-to-use, and genuinely interesting to me.

## Big Thanks To
- [Wikipedia's Tkinter article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tkinter), especially the section on the [object-oriented implementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tkinter#Simple_application).
- [WVU's Don McLaughlin](https://directory.statler.wvu.edu/faculty-staff-directory/don-mclaughlin), who introduced me to Tkinter last year and assigned me the homework upon which this project is based.
- ChatGPT, my best buddy.
- [Neuraline](https://www.youtube.com/@NeuralNine)'s [video on Tkinter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibf5cx221hk&t=954s&pp=ygUwVGtpbnRlciBCZWdpbm5lciBDb3Vyc2UgLSBQeXRob24gR1VJIERldmVsb3BtZW50), which was by far the most succint and practically useful tutorial I could find.
- [The official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html), which I found to be exceptionally well-written and full of great examples.
